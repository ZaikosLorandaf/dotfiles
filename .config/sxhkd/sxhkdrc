# Commands are procedurally added to the manual.

# To do so, for every command, add a line starting
# with `##` which has a generic description of what
# the command does.

# The pdf will associate it with the binding BELOW IT.

# `#` followed by a space will be ignored and treated
# as regular comments.

# `#-#` at the beggining of a line will be converted to
# a header in the manual.
